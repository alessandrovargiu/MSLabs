Advantages vs disadvantages

Analyzing the superposed waveforms we can see the differences between the two designs.

The NANDs considered for standard values of load capacitance have increased power consumption and use more current, we can clearly
notice this looking at the waveform. The tradeoff is a smaller delay, since higher current means higher performance.



Percentage values for delay:
  LOAD: 5.00E-14   |  model: charMaxLoad
  first row  -> LL
  second row -> HS
